# binance-nft-autobuy
A simple script that allows you to buy NFTs on Binance faster

## Responsibility

I do not have any responsibilities for the usage of this script by you or any other person / company. If you are not sure what this code does, do not use it.

## How to use the code
1. Open an NFT sale page 
2. Press F12
3. Go to "Console"
4. Insert the code 
5. Press Enter
6. Wait for the start of the sale 

## Important notes
1. Binance may update their site, making this script useless. It happens because of a classname changes. Classnames are the only viable option to create a fast bot, because analysing a whole site takes a lot of time.
This script was created on 16th April, 2022. Future work is not guaranteed.

2. This script does not support sales with multiple items available (where you can click on a "+" sign). Script was not tested for these items, but should buy 1 item regardless.

3. This script works with the English version of the Binance NFT. Note that Binance may be translated into your language, but not Binance NFT. If Binance NFT is translated from English, script will not work.
